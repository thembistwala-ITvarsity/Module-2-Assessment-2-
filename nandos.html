              <h2>NANDOS</h2>
              <p>Nando's (/nænˈdoʊz/) is a South African multinational fast food chain that specialises in flame-grilled peri-peri style chicken.[a] Founded in Johannesburg in 1987, Nando's operates over 1,200 outlets[1] in 30 countries. Their logo depicts the Rooster of Barcelos, one of the most common symbols of Portugal.</p>
              <p>The restaurant was founded in 1987 in Rosettenville, Johannesburg by Mozambique-born Fernando Duarte and South African-born Robert Brozin. Upon visiting a Colonial Portuguese-African[3] takeaway named Chickenland, and trying the chicken with peri peri (a sauce that was first developed in nearby Mozambique and further refined in South Africa before being exported to other Portuguese territories and mainland Portugal) they bought the restaurant for about 80,000 rand (equivalent to about £25,000 at the time).[4] They renamed the restaurant Nando's after Fernando's first born son. By 1989, the restaurant had three outlets in Johannesburg and one in Portugal.[5][4] Capricorn Ventures International acquired the chain in 1992.[6] As of February 2019, there were 936 Nando's branches in 23 countries worldwide.</p>
