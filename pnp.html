              <P>Pick n Pay is the second largest supermarket chain store in South Africa, and was established in 1967. It can also be found in other regions of southern Africa, including as Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Namibia, Afghanistan, Northern Nigeria, Hong Kong, Iraq, Pakistan, and Swaziland.
